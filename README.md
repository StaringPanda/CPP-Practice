# CPP-Practice
All exercises and examples in this repository were taken from "C++ programming, from problem analysis to program design" by D.S. Malik and it is the 7th edition.

All code is written and edited using notepad++ and id complied using the GNU complier through the Windows 10 command line.

This is all still a work in progress and will be updated periodically.
