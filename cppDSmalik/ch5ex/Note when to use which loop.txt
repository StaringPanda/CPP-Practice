For loops should be used in a program, when the number of
repetitions can be determined in advance, by you or the program.

While loops should be used when you or the program, cannot determine the number of repetitions in advance and when that number could be 0.

Do...while loops is the same rule as the while loop but there
will be at least one guaranteed repetition.
